# Getting Started {#getting_started}

Welcome to the Calm Automation Workshop.

:::info

Estimated time to complete the labs depending on your familiarity level
with Nutanix, Kubernets and Openshift concepts is as follows:

- **Calm 101** - 90 minutes to 120 minutes
- **Calm 201** - 90 minutes to 120 minutes
- **Calm 301** - 30 minutes to 45 minutes

:::

## What's New

- Workshop uses for the following software versions:
  - AOS 5.20.2.1
  - Prism Central pc.2021.9.0.2
  - Calm 3.3.1

## Agenda

- Calm 101
- Calm 201
- Calm 301
## Initial Setup

- Take note of the *Passwords* being used from you RX reservation details
- Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)
- Login to Global Protect VPN if you have access

## Cluster Assignment

The instructor will inform the attendees their assigned clusters.

:::note

If these are Single Node Clusters (SNCs) pay close attention on the networking part. The SNCs are setup and configured differently to the 3 or 4 node clusters

:::

## Environment Details

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images,networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

### Networking

As we are able to provide three/four node clusters and single node clusters in the HPOC environment, we need to describe each sort of cluster separately. The clusters are setup and configured differently.

#### Three/Four node HPOC clusters

Three or four node Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC*XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**42**.*XYZ*.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**42**.*XYZ*.37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.42.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.42.55.37 for the VIP of the Cluster

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

| IP Address     |   Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.37 |  Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP   |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.39 |  **PC** VM IP, Prism Central |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.41  |  **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller   |


Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:


|Network Name     | Address             | VLAN    | DHCP Scope|
|-----------------| ------------------- |-------- | -----------|
|Primary          | 10.42.*XYZ*.1/25    | 0       | 10.42.*XYZ*.50-10.42.*XYZ*.124|
|Secondary        | 10.42.*XYZ*.129/25  | *XYZ1*  | 10.42.*XYZ*.132-10.42.*XYZ*.253|


#### Single Node HPOC Clusters

For some workshops we are using Single Node Clusters (SNC). The reason for this is to allow more people to have a dedicated cluster but still have enough free clusters for the bigger workshops including those for
customers.

The network in the SNC config is using a /26 network. This splits the network address into four equal sizes that can be used for workshops. The below table describes the setup of the network in the four
partitions. It provides essential information for the workshop with respect to the IP addresses and the services running at that IP address.


|Partition 1     |Partition 2      | Partition 3      | Partition 4    | Service     |  Comment

### Credentials

:::note

The *Cluster Password* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

:::

| Credential        | Username                 | Password           |
|------------------ |------------------------- |--------------------|
| Prism Element     | admin                    | *Cluster Password* |

| Prism Central VM  | nutanix                  | *Cluster Password* |

Each cluster has a dedicated domain controller VM, **DC**, responsible for providing AD services for the **NTNXLAB.local** domain. The domain is populated with the following Users and Groups:


| Group            | Username(s)              | Password |
