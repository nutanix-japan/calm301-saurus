# Purpose of the lab

Nutanix Calm Marketplace and ServiceNow integration allowed our customer to provide self service of the underlying infrastructure like VM as a Service, Database as a Service, Kubernetes as a Service and Application as a Service etc. However, some of our customers would like to use a 3rd party Cloud Management Portal or IT Service Management software like BMC Remedy, ManageEngine etc. How can we help this group of customers to achieve this?

One of the key benefits in our Private Cloud solution was to bring public cloud experience into the private cloud. Automation was a key driver behind this. The objectives were to equip our automation SMEs
with the skill sets to help our customers to streamline the process and integrate with disparate technologies through the use of api.

# Create a Blueprint in Calm

Blueprint is like an architect blueprint which design every facet from the pillar columns to the facade of the building. The automation
designer design every aspects of the automation from the provisioning of the VM to installation of packages.

# Understand the Nutanix APIs

When the customer would like to implement the self service of Nutanix
infrastructure in their current ITSM software, the requirements would be
the ability to perform the following operations.

1.  Create Project
2.  Create User
3.  Associate User to a Project
4.  Launch a Nutanix Calm blueprint to provision the VM
5.  Create VM Snapshot
6.  Change Memory or CPU

These operations were available in the Prism Central [v3 API](https://www.nutanix.dev/reference/prism_central/v3/)

Nutanix APIs were available in REST (Representational State Transfer).
REST service could be easily consumed by the different browsers and 3rd
party integrations in the familiar HTTP and HTTPS protocol. These
operations were available in the HTTP/HTTPS protocol and each operation
served a purpose.

1.  **GET** Retrieve representation of the member resource in the
    response body.
2.  **POST** Create a member resource in the member resource using the
    instructions in the request body
3.  **PUT** Replace all the representations of the member resource with
    the representation in the request body.
4.  **PATCH** Update all the representations of the member resource or
    may create the member resource if it does not exist, using the
    instructions in the request body.
5.  **DELETE** Delete all the representations of the member resource

Each API call would comprise of the following:

1.  URL of the REST service

2.  Authentication & Authorization

3.  Type of Authentication: BASIC

4.  Username

5.  Password

6.  Request Parameters. The no of request parameters were dependent on
    the API.

7.  Each API call would return the following status code:

    -   200, 201 (OK)
    -   404 (Not Found)
    -   403 (Authorization Error)
    -   500 (Internal Server Error)

8.  Response Parameters. The no of response parameters were dependent on
    the API

# Use Nutanix for Day 2 Operation

## Clone the centOS VM

The purpose for cloning the Centos VM is to allow the trainee to change the memory of the Centos VM.

1.  Click on **Compute & Storage-\>VM**.

    ![](images/clone-vm-pc2022-6.png.png)

#\. Click on **Clone**. Name it to **CentOS\<trainee number\>**

:   ![](images/vm_clone.png)

# Change the VM Memory using REST API (For illustration of this lab only)

## Use Case

The application team may change the memory of the VM for the application
optimum performance. The application team would want to perform a self
service to change the memory.  **This lab is for illustrative purpose to
use api to change the memory**.  There is another section to use **Update Config** in the blueprint designer
to update vCPU, Memory and Disk below.  

## Translate the use case into api operation

The use case could be translated into 3 operations:

1.  Retrieve a list of VMs for the user to select
2.  Change to the new memory size and power off the VM
3.  Power on the VM

## Operation 1: Retrieve a list of VM for the user to select

1.  Click on the link to examine the api to retrieve a [List of VMs](https://www.nutanix.dev/reference/prism_central/v3/api/vms/postvmslist/) in
    the Nutanix clusters.

2.  Each API call would comprise of the following:

    -   URL of the REST service. **https://Prism Central IP:9440/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list**

    -   Authentication & Authorization:
        -  Type of Authentication -  **BASIC**
        -  Username -  **admin**
        -  Password -  **Prism Central Password**
        -  These are the request parameters.

        ![](images/nutanix_api_pc.png)

        -  This is an example of the request parameter.

        ``` bash
        "kind": "vm",
        "sort_order": "ASCENDING",
        "offset": 0,
        "length": 256,
        "sort_attribute": "vm_name"
        ```

### API Verification with Postman

1.  Open the **Postman**. Key in the **URL of the Prism Central**. This
    is a **POST** request

    ![](images/postman.png)

2.  Fill in the following in the **Authorization** tab.

    ![](images/postman_authorization.png)

3.  Fill in the **Header**.

    ![](images/postman_header.png)

4.  Fill in the following in the **Body**.

    ![](images/postman_body.png)

5.  Click on **Send**

    ![](images/postman_send.png)

6.  Scroll down to view the **response of the REST service call**. This
    is an example of successful response

    ![](images/postman_success.png)

7.  Take note of the response structure. The **VM name** was in
    **entities.metadata.name**. The **VM uuid** was in
    **entities.metadata.uuid**. The VM name was used to display for user
    selection.

    ![](images/api_response.png)

### Create a Dynamic Variable in Calm

1.  The purpose of this section is to create a drop down list of the VMs
    in the Nutanix cluster for user selection.

2. Create the following variables:

    -   PC_IP **Store the value for Prism Central IP**
    -   newMemSize **Store the value for New Memory Size in Mb**
    
    ![](images/variable_new_memory.png)

3.  Check the **Mark this variable mandatory** to allow the user to key
    in the new memory size.

    ![](images/variable_mandatory.png)

4.  Create a dynamic variable named vmname

    ![](images/variable_vmname.png)

5.  Examine the following python scripts. This section of the python
    script configured the user name, password, Prism Central IP address
    (destination for the api) and the request structure. Copy this
    contents into the escript


    ```python
    user = "admin"
    password = "Fill in the password in your PC"
    ip = "Fill in the PC IP"
    def process_request(url, method, user, password, headers, payload=None):
      r = urlreq(url, verb=method, auth="BASIC", user=user, passwd=password, params=payload, 
    verify=False, headers=headers)
    return r
    ```

6.  The payload was the mandatory request parameters to be passed into
    the api. Please copy the contents into the escript

    ``` python
    payload = {
     "kind": "vm",
     "sort_order": "ASCENDING",
     "offset": 0,
     "length": 256,
     "sort_attribute": "vm_name"
    }
    ```

7.  This section of the python script was to invoke the request to the
    api. Copy this section of the scripts into the escript

    ``` python
    base_url = "https://" + ip + ":9440/api/nutanix/v3/vms"
    url = base_url + "/list"
    headers = {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    url_method = "POST"
    
    r = process_request(url, url_method, user, password, headers, json.dumps(payload))
    ```

8.  This section of the python script was to extract the vm name from
    the api response

    ``` python
    vm_list = []
    vm_list_json = r.json()
    for vm in vm_list_json['entities']:
     if vm['spec']: #sometimes this value will be '{}'
       vm_list.append("{}".format(vm['spec']['name']))
    print ','.join(vm_list) 
    ```

9. This was the picture of the consolidated script.

    ![](images/api_list_vm.png)

10.  Check the **Mark this variable mandatory** to allow the user to select the vm.

## Operation 2: Retrieve the VM details, Update the new memory and power off the VM

1.  On the left side of the screen, create a new service.  Click on **+**

    ![](images/add-service-pc2022-6.png)

2.  On the right side of the screen, Select **Existing Service**.  Key in **127.0.0.1** in IP address.

    ![](images/existing-service-details-pc2022-6.png)

3.  Scroll down.  Select the credential.  Uncheck the **Check log-in upon create**

    ![](images\connection-pc2022-6.png)


4.  Click on **Package-\>Install**. Click on **+ Task**

    ![](images/package_install.png)

5.  Name the task: **UpdateMemory**

    -   Type: Execute
    -   Script Type: Escript

    ![](images/task-update-memory-pc2022-6.png)

5.  Refer to the following api to update the specification of the [VM API](https://www.nutanix.dev/reference/prism_central/v3/api/vms/putvmsuuid)

6.  Copy the contents into the escript. This section of the escript defines the following:

    -   Credential
    -   Destination of the API: \<Prism Central\>
    -   Define the structure for the http request.

    ``` python
    user = "@@{PC.username}@@"
    password = "@@{PC.secret}@@"
    ip = "@@{PC_IP}@@"
    
    def process_request(url, method, user, password, headers, payload=None):
    r = urlreq(url, verb=method, auth="BASIC", user=user, passwd=password, params=payload, verify=False, headers=headers)
    return r
    ```

8.  Copy the contents into the escript. This section of the escript
    define the request parameters to filter the specific VM instead of
    all the VMs in the cluster.

    ``` python
    payload = {
     "filter": "vm_name==@@{vmname}@@",
     "kind": "vm",
     "sort_order": "ASCENDING",
     "offset": 0,
     "length": 256,
     "sort_attribute": "vm_name"
    }  
    ```

9.  Copy the contents into the escript. This section will execute and
    retrieve the specific VM.

    ``` python
    base_url = "https://" + ip + ":9440/api/nutanix/v3/vms"
    url = base_url + "/list"
    headers = {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    url_method = "POST"
    
    r = process_request(url, url_method, user, password, headers, json.dumps(payload))
    print "Response Status: " + str(r.status_code)
    vm_list_json = r.json()
    for vm in vm_list_json['entities']:
     if vm['spec']: #sometimes this value will be '{}'
       if (vm['spec']['name'] == "@@{vmname}@@"):
         vm_json = vm   
    ```

10.  Copy the contents into the escript. This section manipulates the
    json contents to change to the new memory size and power off the VM.

    ``` python
    del vm_json['status']
    del vm_json['spec']['resources']['memory_size_mib']
    del vm_json['spec']['resources']['power_state']
    
    vm_json['spec']['resources']['memory_size_mib'] = @@{newMemSize}@@
    vm_json['spec']['resources']['power_state'] = "OFF"
    print "VM JSON: " + json.dumps(vm_json)
    ```

11. Copy the contents into the escript. This section will put the new
    json specification to the Prism Central to execute the changes. If
    Prism Central executed the changes successfully, it will return
    exit 0. Otherwise, it is exit 1.

    ``` python
    url = base_url + "/" + str(vm_json['metadata']['uuid'])
    url_method = "PUT"
    r = process_request(url, url_method, user, password, headers, json.dumps(vm_json))
    print "Response Status: " + str(r.status_code)
    print "Response: ", r.json()
    if (r.ok):
     sleep(120)
     exit(0)
    else:  
     exit(1)  
    ```
